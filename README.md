# Landing Page Project

> **Project Brief**: To build a multi-section landing page, with a dynamically updating navigational menu based on the amount of content that is added to the page.

## Project Highlights
### Project Summary
In this project, I used JavaScript to navigate through the DOM and dynamically build the navigation menu, including smooth scroll behaviour to allow sections to fit nicely in the viewport and applied Intersection Observer to set and style the active state. 

### Features
- Responsive Web Design
- Dynamic Navigation
- Section Active State
- Smooth Scrolling

## Special Comemnts


- A tutorial on Insersection Observer API should have been in the course.
